# superstar-hangul
비밀이다 🤫

## Quickstart

Please install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to be able to run this project! You may need to install Homebrew or other package manager of choice to get yarn :/

Once you have that all set up, clone the repo, `cd superstar-hangul` and run `yarn start`. That should launch the main page of the app.
화이팅!!

## Notes
At the moment, all the node_modules have been checked in so that contributors can get started quickly without dealing with running install commands and possibly dealing with node/yarn/other dependency inconsistencies across environments.
If it becomes unwieldy or creates conflicts for other developers, they can be removed.
