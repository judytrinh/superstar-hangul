# superstar-hangul
비밀이다 🤫

Please install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to be able to run this project! You may need to install Homebrew or other package manager of choice to get yarn :/

Once you have that all set up, clone the repo, `cd superstar-hangul` and run `yarn start`. That should launch the main page of the app.
화이팅!!
